Buckhorn, North Carolina - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,Green Left is an anti-capitalist and eco-socialist grouping within the Green Party of England and Wales. It seeks to constitute a network for socialists and other like minded invividuals in the Green Party, whilst acting as an outreach body that will communicate the party's left wing policies to other socialists and anti-capitalists outside the party. It includes some prominent members of the Green Party of England and Wales and held its first meeting on 4 June 2006.[1] Like members of the Alliance for Green Socialism (who choose to organize separately from the Green Party of England and Wales), Green Left members were early supporters of the Ecosocialist International Network (EIN).
