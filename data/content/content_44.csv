Cratloe GAA - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia,The safe drive away time (SDAT) or minimum drive away time (MDAT) refers to the time required until a windscreen installation, e.g. after a glass replacement is considered to be safe to drive again.[1] Criteria are laid down in U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 212/208 to prove the reliability of adhesive systems. Typically the SDAT is verified with crash tests but also with high speed laboratory test methods.
